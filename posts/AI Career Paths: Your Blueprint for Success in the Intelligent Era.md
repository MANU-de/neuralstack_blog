## How to get started in the AI ​​field 🪜

The transition to AI requires a strategic mix of formal education, practical experience, and continuous learning.

**Educational Paths**

* **Formal Degrees:** A **Bachelor’s or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, or a related quantitative field** provides a solid theoretical foundation. For research-focused roles, a Ph.D. is often a requirement.
    
* **Online Courses and Specializations:** For developers looking to pivot, structured online courses from platforms like Coursera, edX, and DataCamp are excellent resources. Look for specializations in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI**. These courses offer foundational knowledge and practical coding exercises.
    

**Practical Experience and Portfolio Building** 💻

Theory is only half the battle; employers prioritize demonstrable skills.

* **Projects, Projects, Projects:** Build a robust portfolio on GitHub. Focus on end-to-end projects that go beyond basic tutorials.
    
    * **ML Engineers:** Deploy a working model (e.g., a recommendation system) using cloud services.
        
    * **Data Scientists:** Complete projects involving data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and building predictive models on real-world datasets (e.g., from **Kaggle**).
        
    * **NLP/CV:** Create a text summarizer, an image classifier, or a generative art model.
        
* **Competitions:** Participate in data science competitions on platforms like Kaggle. The experience of solving real-world problems under time constraints is invaluable.
