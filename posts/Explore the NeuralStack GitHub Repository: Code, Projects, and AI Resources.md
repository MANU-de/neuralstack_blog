## Introduction

At *NeuralStack*, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical application in AI development. In addition to the insights and tutorials in this blog, I've created an open GitHub repository where you can find real-world code, AI agent experiments, and practical examples.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast looking to build your own agent workflows, this repository is a place to explore, learn, and collaborate.

## **What Youâ€™ll Find in the Repository**

The **NeuralStack GitHub repository** includes:

* **Code samples** from my blog articles (Python-based agent setups, workflows, etc.)
    
* **Templates** for AI agents and tool integrations
    
* **Mini-projects** demonstrating agentic workflows in action
    
* **MLOps utilities** for deploying and maintaining models
    
* **Resources** for learning and prototyping
